Generate SAPUI5 Applciation base on UI5 Tooling.

# References
I based my work on multiple sources. 
- SAPui5 template is based on https://github.com/SAP/openui5-worklist-app
- The generator I used to help mine is https://github.com/SAP/generator-easy-ui5

I wanted to fork the Easy-ui5 generator but the structre was not what I expected. I do not want the abillity to add HTML or JS view. The application I wanted to have as template should have App.view as starting point. Furthermore, I wanted to used the semantic page to build my application.
